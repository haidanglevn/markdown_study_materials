# Markdown language and README files
![Markdown mark](./Markdown-mark.svg)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Read more from [Markdown project website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Markdown file extensions are `.md` and `.markdown`

Markdown language is used for creating README files. It is also useful to know it if you are adding comments and contributing on GitHub. See more about [Writting on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github).

## Why projects should include README file?

The README file contains information about the project and facilitates readers' understanding of the project you have created.

## Do I need to have it also?

Yes, it is good practice to include a README file in your project. 

The primary purpose of the README file is to introduce and explain what the project is about. You want people to know what that project is, right? Then be respectful and give reviewers a summary. This way, readers can decide if it's worth their time or not.

## What I should write in README?

Good README includes: 

- Name of the project
- Introduction and/or short description of the project (a simple way to write a description is to answer questions like what, who and why)
    - What is the aim/goal of that project? What does it do? What problem does it try to solve?
    - Who is the target group?
    - Why you did it? 
- Technologies used 
- Setup and usage
    - Include demo and/or live page links
    - Write a short description of how to set up that project
- Visuals (screenshots of application)
- Sources (if you got inspired and you copied someone's project - it is nice to give credits to them and the original project)
- Authors and acknowledgement
- Other information

## Where I should put README file? 

Include the README file on your project root.

## Ok, I got your point; what next? 

Start adding README files to your projects. :wink:

In [README template](README-template.md) file, you get a basic starter for your README file. Feel free to use it for your next project.
