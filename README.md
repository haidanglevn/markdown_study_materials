## Should I use it?

Yes, it is good practice to include a README file. The primary purpose of the README file is to introduce and explain what the project is about. 


## What I should write in README?

Good README includes: 

- Name of the project
- Introduction and/or short description of the project (a simple way to write a description is to answer questions like what, who and why)
    - What is the aim/goal of that project? What does it do? What problem does it try to solve?
    - Who is the target group?
    - Why you did it? 
- Technologies used 
- Setup and usage
    - Include demo and/or live page links
    - Write a short description of how to set up that project
- Visuals (screenshots of application)
- Sources (if you got inspired and you copied someone's project - it is nice to give credits to them and the original project)
- Authors and acknowledgement

## Where I should put README file? 

Include the README file on your project root.

## Ok, I got your point; what next? 

Start adding README files to your projects. :wink:
